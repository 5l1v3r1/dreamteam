	<div id="aboutT2" class="wwwFont">In interpreting her clientâs brief Katarzyna abandons realism, drawing her inspiration from abstraction and futurism, and relying on her own vivid imagination. The possibilities of unbounded space and the concept of kinetic sculpture form the basis of her design philosophy.<br><br>She is fascinated by nature and light and often plays with gravity, making hefty constructions appear weightless. </div>
